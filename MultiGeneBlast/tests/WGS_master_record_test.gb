COMMENT     REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence was derived from
            ABAX00000000.
            On Nov 21, 2007 this sequence version replaced NZ_ABAX00000000.1.
            The Anaerostipes caccae DSM 14662 whole genome shotgun (WGS)
            project has the project accession NZ_ABAX00000000.  This version of
            the project (03) has the accession number NZ_ABAX03000000, and
            consists of sequences ABAX03000001-ABAX03000039.
            Anaerostipes caccae (GenBank Accession Number: AJ270487) is a
            member of the division Firmicutes. It is an acetate-converting
            butyrate-producing colon bacteria that is involved in metabolic
            cross-feeding with Bifidobacterium species (Falony et. al. (2006),
            Belenguer et. al. (2006)). The sequenced strain was obtained from
            Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ)
            (DSM 14662).
            
            We have collected 9.8X coverage in plasmid end reads (pOTW13 and
            pJAZZ vectors) and 454 reads. We have performed one round of
            automated sequence improvement(pre-finishing), along with manual
            improvement that includes breaking apart any mis-assembly, and
            making manual joins where possible. Manual edits also are made
            where the consensus appears to be incorrect. All low quality data
            on the ends of contigs is removed. Contigs are ordered and oriented
            where possible.
            
            Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid
            culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing
            strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl
            sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome
            sequences.  454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life
            Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were
            converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with
            400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads.  Finally, PCAP
            (Huang, et al, Genome Research, 13:2164, (2003)) was used to
            assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary
            reads.
            
            This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive, sequence-based
            survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota.  A joint
            effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at
            Washington University School of Medicine, the purpose of this
            survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad
            view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major
            divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community.
            
            Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2
            v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were
            blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions
            generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined
            using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and
            Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not
            necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.
            This information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing
            metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of
            this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our
            View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'
            (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS
            eq.pdf). These studies are supported by National Human Genome
            Research Institute.

            Annotation was added to the contigs in February 2008.
